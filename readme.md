I had a dream

A dream where John Lennon could tune a piano without being murdered,
A dream where Michael Jackson could love children without being defamed as a pedophile,
A dream where all people, regardless of ethnicity, religion, or culture, live together in peace;

and a tool that plays all media in a harmonious frequency, harmonizing all the water in the world, every soul, and every spirit.

Unfortunately, my abilities are limited.

I ask every programmer who understands this vision to implement it better than I have.

Feel free to improve and further develop this idea and concept :)
